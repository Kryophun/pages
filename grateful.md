# Why is Aaron telling me he's grateful out of the blue? Does he want something from me? Is he leaving Microsoft? Is he dying?

No, none of those things. I think it's important to always be aware of how much we depend on other people and how much other people help us (intentionally or unintentionally).
It's easy to forget that. It's easy for **ME** to forget that. The way I remind myself of that is to have a weekly appointment on my calendar (Thursday mornings, if you are curious) to let someone know I am grateful for them or something they've done.

Often people wonder why I am randomly telling them I am grateful and so I made this page to explain.

Today, you are the recipient of my gratitude. Thanks!

You don't have to do anything in return; you don't have to say anything. Just know that I am grateful for you.
